# SickAssist

Write out your feelings and symptoms, and a specially-trained predictive model will suggest remedies.
Don't think about it too much, just write as if you're chatting to a friend!

## Framework

The website is built on [React](https://react.dev) with a [Python](https://www.python.org) backend.
The predictive model being used is based on top of Google Gemini.

## Model

Our predictive model is trained on a large medical dataset to accurate analyze user's symptoms and provide possible diseases with a mathematical confidence score. We cleaned user input in order for the model to process it, then presented the output data from the model in a clean and readable manner to the users.
