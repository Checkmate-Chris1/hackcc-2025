Running the website's frontend (the actual site that people see):

1. Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer. If you don't, go to nodejs.org 

2. Right click on the frontend folder and click "Open in Integrated Terminal"
(ex. "C:\Users\My-User\Documents\GitHub\hackcc-2025\frontend")

3. Type "npm install". (You only have to do this once ever)

Then once you are there type in "npm run dev" and it should start the website.
